## Description

Street Runner is a 3D endless runner game developed in C++ using OpenGL (GLUT). The game features a procedurally generated road system where the player controls a character that must avoid obstacles and collect coins while the environment continuously scrolls forward.

The project implements classic computer graphics algorithms such as the DDA Line Drawing Algorithm and the Midpoint Circle Algorithm to render custom shapes and visual elements. The environment includes dynamic scenery such as trees, houses, windmills, clouds, and a day–night sky cycle.

As the game progresses, difficulty increases gradually through dynamic speed scaling. The system also includes multiple game states (Menu, Playing, Paused, Countdown, Game Over), a high score saving mechanism, and smooth player movement with jump physics.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of computer graphics, game loop logic, procedural generation, collision detection, and real-time rendering using OpenGL.
